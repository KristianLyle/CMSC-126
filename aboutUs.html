        <p class="missionContent">
            Our mission is to promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of the precolonial history 
            of the Philippines, with a focus on decolonizing and deconstructing the Eurocentric narratives 
            that have dominated Philippine history. We aim to highlight the rich and diverse cultural 
            heritage of the various Indigenous peoples that inhabited the archipelago long before the 
            arrival of the Spanish colonizers. Through our website, we strive to provide a platform for 
            marginalized voices and perspectives, and to encourage a more inclusive and equitable 
            approach to historical inquiry and education. By challenging the colonial legacy that still 
            shapes the way we view Philippine history today, we hope to contribute to a more just and 
            compassionate society that values and respects the dignity and agency of all its members.
