                The Sama Bajau peoples are a group of diverse populations who speak languages belonging to the Sama Bajau language family. They are one of the largest language families in the world, with over 1,200 different languages spoken across Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Madagascar. In the Philippines, the majority of precolonial Filipinos belong to the Sama Bajau language family and share common cultural and genetic traits.
                The Sama Bajau peoples are believed to have originated in Taiwan around 4,000-5,000 years ago and gradually spread southward to the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other parts of Southeast Asia, as well as eastward to Oceania, including Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia.
                In the Philippines, some of the major Sama Bajau groups include:
                Tagalog - the largest ethnic group in the Philippines, primarily located in Central Luzon and Metro Manila.
                Ilocano - the third-largest ethnic group in the Philippines, mainly located in the Ilocos Region of Northern Luzon.
                Visayan - a group of ethnolinguistic groups primarily located in the Visayas islands, including Cebuano, Hiligaynon, and Waray.
                Bicolano - an ethnic group located in the Bicol Region of Southern Luzon, known for their spicy cuisine and Mayon Volcano.
                Kapampangan - an ethnic group located in Pampanga and neighboring provinces in Central Luzon, known for their distinct language and cuisine.
                Overall, the Sama Bajau peoples have had a significant impact on the cultural and linguistic diversity of the Philippines, and their legacy can still be seen in many aspects of Filipino culture today.
